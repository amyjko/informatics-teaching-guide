		<h1>Informatics students</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko, Ph.D.</div>

    <p>
			Informatics students are incredibly diverse. 
			They come from all over the world, have different perspectives and values, and have different short term and long term goals. 
			Some are very career driven, some are very curious; some are grateful for their opportunity to be at UW, some are more entitled.
			We have international students from across the world (though mostly Asia), we have students from around the United States (though mostly west coast), and we have a small majority of students from around Washington state (though more western Washington than eastern).
			The university also attracts a large proportion of students who are the first in their families to attend college.
		</p>

		<p>
			There are some generalizations I can make about our students, despite their diversity, and because of our curriculum and admissions processes:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>They're fascinated by information technology.</li>
			<li>They're curious about the human, social, and ethical dimensions of technology, but not as curious as students in arts and the humanities.</li>
			<li>Many pursue Informatics because of the economic security it promises, not because of an intrinsic interest they have in designing or building information technology.</li>
			<li>They are often very busy, with too many classes, too much part time work, too much commuting to campus, and too many side projects. They juggle a lot, and often are still learning how to juggle well.</li>
			<li>They are largely very driven students. They want to learn, they want to have impact, and they want to create.</li>
			<li>Most have a utopian view of technology, rather than a dystopian one. This is shifting as society's view of computing is becoming more nuanced.</li>
			<li>Informatics students support each other. It's a very tight learning community, and they rely on each other to learn, to navigate their experiences, and to get information.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			In some ways, there are similarities between Informatics students and Computer Science students. 
			They both tend to pursue jobs in the software industry, for example. 
			However, Informatics students tend to want a much more holistic view of computing, and are also curious about non-computational aspects of information, such as ethics, policy, human experience, human values, and society.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			While there are some consistencies in our students interest, they is considerable diversity in the <strong>resources</strong> they have to attend to learning:
		</p>

		<p>Many students struggle to maintain the conditions necessary for learning, and often this is out of their control. Here are some of the many factors I've encountered while teaching at UW:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Many students don't have good <strong>sleep hygiene</strong>, and therefore don't sleep enough to stay awake in class. 
				Let them sleep; they're not going to learn anything if they're barely conscious. 
				And don't set deadlines at midnight; that just incentivized poor sleep hygiene.
			</li>
			<li>
				Students live further away from campus every year and struggle to get to <strong>commute</strong> to campus reliability. 
				Be tolerant of some variation in arrival times.
				Because you're likely paid more than them, they likely commute much further than you to 
			</li>
			<li>
				As the cost of education at increases, students are having to <strong>work</strong> more, sometimes full-time, to pay for their education. 
				This might mean they can't attend class or do homework. 
				Remember that failure to do assigned work is not necessarily laziness, but more likely a carefully made choice about triaging time. 
				Consider more flexible policies that support this triage.
			</li>
			<li>
				Some students experience significant <strong>hardship</strong> in school: poverty, hunger, sexual assault, deaths in the family, divorce, childcare obligations. 
				School isn't some shield against these things; and at UW, where we admit a high proportion of first generation college students, many of these are common experiences. 
				It's hard to focus on learning when there are bigger events. 
				If you notice someone not submitting work, reach out to them and offer them campus resources.
			</li>
			<li>
				Many students have <strong>physical disabilities</strong>, such as blindness, deafness, low-vision, and other physical impairments that limit their ability to perceive or access the materials that teachers create. 
				Use the many tools provided on campus to test the accessibility of your materials.
			</li>
			<li>
				Many students have <strong>invisible disabilities</strong>, including learning disabilities, attentional disorders, and chronic mental health problems, that limit their ability to read, sit for long periods of time without moving, or sustain motivation to learn. 
				And because of stigma, many students do not disclose these. 
				If you notice a student struggling, have a conversation about how you can help.
			</li>
			<li>
				Many students are not <strong>fluent</strong> enough in English to be able to use proper spelling or grammar. 
				If you assess spelling and grammar, recognize that while this might result in learning, it also disadvantages students who haven't had nearly as much time to master English.
			</li>
			<li>
				Many students <strong>overcommit</strong>, because they haven't yet mastered tracking their commitments or managing their time.
			</li>
			<li>
				Many students don't have a consistent, quite, stable <strong>environment for studying</strong>. 
				They may live with a large family, have many child-care responsibilities, or have an unstable home life.
			</li>
			<li>
				Some students, whether because of poverty or fasting for Ramadan, do not eat enough to remain <strong>alert</strong> in class, making it hard to focus on learning.
			</li>
			<li>
				Some students don't have the money to have a <strong>computer</strong> or printer at home, or can't afford printing at school.
				We try to offer enough rentals in iSchool IT, but students often do not know they can borrow them.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			It's tempting to be unmoving in your consistent application of course rules, but students' lives are complex. 
			If you encounter a situation you didn't anticipate, make a reasonable exception. 
			There's nothing worse than having a teacher demand you do something that you simply can't do.
		</p>

		<p>
			While all of this complexity in student experience can be overwhelming, I find it easiest to simply remember that students' lives are as complex as ours.
			That doesn't mean you have to coddle them, but it does mean you have to make some tough choices about what assumptions you want to make about what's feasible and human for them to do in your class.
