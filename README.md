# The Informatics teaching guide
This is a short book on teaching in the University of Washington Informatics undergraduate program. Much of this book might be relevant to any undergraduate teaching, but I use a lot of examples that are likely specific to the University of Washington and the students that we tend to admit to the university and the Informatics degree.

I wrote it to primarily help in my role as the program chair of the degree; I often get asked for guidance on teaching from our core faculty, guest faculty, Ph.D. students, and TAs, and decided to centralize some of the more common ideas and advice that I share in one place. The book should help everyone learn more efficiently and help me focus on more advanced questions about teaching.

This book is only useful if it serves your needs; please file issues if there are things you want it to cover, questions you have, etc. The more feedback, the better it will get!
