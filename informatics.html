    <p>
			Informatics students are incredibly diverse. 
			They come from all over the world, have different perspectives and values, and have different short term and long term goals. 
			Some are very career driven, some are very curious; some are grateful for their opportunity to be at UW, some are more entitled.
			We have international students from across the world (though mostly Asia), we have students from around the United States (though mostly west coast), and we have a small majority of students from around Washington state (though more western Washington than eastern).
			The university also attracts a large proportion of students who are the first in their families to attend college.
		</p>

		<p>
			There are some generalizations I can make about our students, despite their diversity, and because of our curriculum and admissions processes:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>They're fascinated by information technology.</li>
			<li>They're curious about the human, social, and ethical dimensions of technology, but not as curious as students in arts and the humanities.</li>
			<li>Many pursue Informatics because of the economic security it promises, not because of an intrinsic interest they have in designing or building information technology.</li>
			<li>They are often very busy, with too many classes, too much part time work, too much commuting to campus, and too many side projects. They juggle a lot, and often are still learning how to juggle well.</li>
			<li>They are largely very driven students. They want to learn, they want to have impact, and they want to create.</li>
			<li>Most have a utopian view of technology, rather than a dystopian one. This is shifting as society's view of computing is becoming more nuanced.</li>
			<li>Informatics students support each other. It's a very tight learning community, and they rely on each other to learn, to navigate their experiences, and to get information.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			In some ways, there are similarities between Informatics students and Computer Science students. 
			They both tend to pursue jobs in the software industry, for example. 
			However, Informatics students tend to want a much more holistic view of computing, and are also curious about non-computational aspects of information, such as ethics, policy, human experience, human values, and society.
