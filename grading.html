			<a href="https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/grading-is-ineffective-harmful-and-unjust-lets-stop-doing-it-52d2ef8ffc47" target="_blank">I'm not a fan of grading</a>. 
			But before I explain why, let me deconstruct what I mean by grading.
		</p>

		<p>
			When we say grading, we're usually referring to <strong>summative assessment</strong>. 
			Summative assessments are essentially records of learning. 
			They're measurements taken at a moment in time of what someone knows. 
			Most practices in higher education are to take all these snapshots and then aggregate them in some way, then record that as a final grade on a transcript. 
			This is different from formative assessment, which is diagnostic in nature: it helps measure what a learner does and doesn't know, to support their deliberate practice.
		</p>

		<p>
			Formative assessment is incredibly helpful; summative is not. 
			Summative assessments warp motivations, they're confounded by all of the resource issues earlier in this guide (in that they end up measuring students' lack of resources rather than their knowledge), and they're often used to allocate further resources (e.g., entry into a major, scholarships). 
			This might all be fine if our measurements of learning were good and students had all the resources they needed to learn. 
			Unfortunately, neither are the case.
		</p>

		<p>
			Given this, I recommend you attempt to devise a grading scheme that is flexible enough to support diversity in student resources, gives lots of pass/fail opportunities to practice and get formative assessment, and provides a more focused, end-of-quarter opportunities for summative assessment. 
			This approach gives most of the quarter time for practice, then saves the archival measurement of knowledge for after the learning has occurred, not during.
		</p>

		<p>
			You might be worried that this inflates grades. 
			That's a different issue. Grade inflation happens when faculty are afraid of retaliation for low grades. 
			I'm recommending something different: clear expectations, a strong focus on personalized feedback and practice, and a targeted but limited application of summative assessment. 
			Make the summative assessment half the grade if you like, so you still get a wide range of grade points. 
			That will have the consequence of motivating learners to attend to the feedback you give throughout the quarter, to the extent they believe the practice is relevant to the end of quarter assessment.
		</p>

		<p>
			Similarly, regrades might sound like another path to grade inflation, but in reality, they're just an opportunity for students to get more feedback and get further practice. 
			Give students as many regrade opportunities as you're willing to spend time on, and they will learn more.
		</p>

		<p>
			Remember, if the goal is for everyone to learn, then success is that everyone gets a well-deserved 4.0. 
			Try to design your grading scheme and syllabus to achieve this, and take it as at least partly a personal failure that not every student reaches this level of achievement.
